Description: Advanced statistical methods to model and adjust for bias in meta-analysis. More standard methods, i.e. tests for bias in meta-analysis and the trim-and-fill method are provided in R package meta. Main purpose of these methods is to evaluate how sensitive the result of a meta-analysis is to potential bias in meta-analysis. The following methods are available:
 - Copas selection model;
 - limit meta-analysis;
